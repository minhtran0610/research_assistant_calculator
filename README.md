# research_assistant_calculator

This is a web-based demonstrations on how we can create different data mashups to calculate CO2 emissions of different trips. This demo belongs to the project:
Experiment with data mashups and report/demonstrate, supervised by Professor Kari Syst√§ and Assistant Professor Outi Sievi-Korte.

The web system contains 2 demos for 2 types of vehicles: internal combustion engine (ICE) passenger cars and electric passenger cars. Comparisons between different cars
and trips are also possible.

The documentations of the demo can be found in the web system. The summary of the research can be found here: https://tuni-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/minh_s_tran_tuni_fi/ETF189ScuppEhJy2jzvgXXgByGD8WpGbsxxvur8fJ1p1uQ?e=0hS8NE.
